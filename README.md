# Irrigation-Embedded-System
An STM32-based smart irrigation controller with a 24-hour schedule, depth sensing, and closed-loop pump control. Firmware (C) implements a timer-driven scheduler, UART diagnostics, and drivers for HC-SR04 (TIM5 input-capture), RPM sensor (EXTI), DC motor PWM (TIM3), and servo valve (TIM2). The system reads a potentiometer via ADC for manual mode, enforces safety states (“reservoir empty”, end-of-day), and logs hourly metrics (clock, pipe, PWM, RPM, depth). Hardware is a 2-layer Proteus PCB with 5 V↔3.3 V level shifting, L9110 motor driver, BCD display interface, SWD/debug headers, and robust power (buck 5 V + 3.3 V LDO, decoupling/grounding). Result: deterministic timing, stable depth/RPM via debounced ISRs and fixed-point filtering, and one-button run/setup operation.
